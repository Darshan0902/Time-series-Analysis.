Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time .In time series analysis, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly. However, this type of analysis is not merely the act of collecting data over time. What sets time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show how variables change over time.
